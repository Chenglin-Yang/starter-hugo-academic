I am currently a third-year CS Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Distinguished_Professorships"> Bloomberg Distinguished Professor</a> <a href="https://cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/"><b>Alan Yuille</b></a>.

I received my M.S. in Robotics from Johns Hopkins University. Before that, I obtained my B.E. in Engineering Mechanics from Beijing Jiaotong University, where I am honored to work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changjiang_Scholars_Program"> Changjiang Distinguished Professor</a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=rNzP5OAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN"> <b>Yue-Sheng Wang</b> </a>. I will never forget the time spent in Mechanics which teaches me to be grateful and concentrate.
